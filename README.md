# DMEdatabase

This is a solo project run by me, Jamie. 

Current problems:
Medical supply requisitions are currently done by hand. 
No way to know what supplies are currently on hand without walking to the supply room. No way to connect supply quantities to staff or patients. 

Goals:
Create a SQL database containing the following:
Patient name, DOB, insurance
Nurses' name
DME name, type (blood, wound, colostomy, etc), brand, quantity, price per unit
Transactions date, nurse, patient, item, quantities

Create a website for users to: (technically I could just use SQL workbench but my coworkers are old)
look up item quantities
add item quantities
input transactions
view which patients use the most supplies

Lofty goals:
add user permissions
create a barcode-scan feature
